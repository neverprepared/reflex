# Reflex - Claude Code Plugin

Reflex is a Claude Code plugin providing skills and RAG integration for application development, infrastructure, and data engineering workflows.

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution
- Run independent subagents in parallel (multiple Task tool calls in one message)
- Use `model: "haiku"` for quick, straightforward subtasks to minimize cost/latency
- Use background subagents (`run_in_background: true`) for long-running tasks while continuing other work

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user, update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff your behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Lateness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
- **Respect CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR**: NEVER hardcode `~/.claude` or `$HOME/.claude`. Always use `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}` to resolve the Claude config directory. This applies to all bash commands, scripts, and file path references. Users may have a custom config directory set and hardcoded paths will break their setup.

## Context Management

- **Monitor context usage**: When context feels heavy (~85% through a long session), proactively suggest `/reflex:handoff` to generate a continuation document
- **Handoff docs**: Use `/reflex:handoff` to create a structured summary for seamless session continuation
- **Periodic CLAUDE.md review**: At the start of complex tasks, re-read project CLAUDE.md to ensure alignment with project conventions
- **Offload to subagents**: Heavy exploration and research should happen in subagents to preserve main context for decision-making

## MCP Server Management

MCP servers are managed separately from the plugin. The plugin provides a **catalog** of available servers; users install and enable the ones they need.

- **Catalog**: `plugins/reflex/mcp-catalog.json` — registry of all available servers
- **User config**: `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/reflex/mcp-config.json` — tracks installed/enabled state
- **Registration**: Servers are registered via `claude mcp add-json --scope user` (stored in `.claude.json`)
- **Tool names**: `mcp__<server>__<tool>` (e.g., `mcp__atlassian__jira_search`)

Key commands:
- `/reflex:mcp select` — interactive selection to install/uninstall servers
- `/reflex:mcp enable` — interactive selection to enable/disable installed servers
- `/reflex:mcp install <server>` / `uninstall` / `enable` / `disable` — non-interactive management
- `/reflex:mcp status` — show credential readiness per server

## Performance

- **Enable tool search**: For faster startup with many MCP servers, users should enable lazy tool loading:
  ```bash
  claude config set --global toolSearchEnabled true
  ```
  This loads tool definitions on demand instead of all at once, reducing startup time when Reflex's MCP servers are active.

| workflow-orchestrator | Orchestrates multi-step workflows across specialized subagents |

Most agent functionality is provided by official plugins (testing-suite, security-pro, documentation-generator, developer-essentials) and Reflex skills.

## Web Search Integration

**Auto-Storage**: WebSearch results are automatically stored in Qdrant when available. This builds a persistent knowledge base over time.

**Auto-Retrieve Workflow**:

1. **Check Qdrant First**: Before using WebSearch, check if the answer exists in stored knowledge:
   ```
   Tool: qdrant-find
   Query: "<user's question>"
   ```

2. **Evaluate Freshness**: If results found, check `harvested_at` metadata:
   - Recent (< 1 week): Use directly
   - Older (1 week - 1 month): Supplement with fresh search
   - Stale (> 1 month): Prefer fresh search, update storage

3. **Search When Needed**: If stored knowledge is insufficient or user explicitly requests "current/latest/fresh" information:
   ```
   Tool: WebSearch
   Query: "<refined query>"
   ```

4. **Auto-Storage**: Results are automatically stored with rich metadata (no manual action needed)

**Skip Qdrant Check When**:
- User explicitly asks for "latest", "current", "fresh", "today's" information
- Query is time-sensitive (news, prices, weather, events)
- User says "search the web" or similar explicit directive

**Disable Auto-Storage** (if needed):
```bash
export REFLEX_QDRANT_AUTOSAVE=false
```

## Git Commits

When committing changes, use this format:

```
<summary line>

<optional body>
```

**No AI attribution.** Do NOT add Co-Authored-By lines, "Generated with" footers, or any other AI tool branding to commits.

**Before pushing**, always sync with the remote to avoid rejected pushes:

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

If the rebase has conflicts, stop and inform the user. Do NOT resolve conflicts automatically — let the user decide the strategy.

## LangFuse Observability

Reflex includes LangFuse integration for tracing tool calls and agent interactions. Tracing is always active when credentials are present — no toggle needed. The PostToolUse hook exits silently when credentials are missing or LangFuse is unreachable.

**Check status:**
```bash
/reflex:langfuse status  # Show configuration and connectivity
```

**Required environment variables:**
```bash
export LANGFUSE_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # Optional, defaults to localhost
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-..."
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-..."
```

## Installation

**From marketplace:**
```
/plugin marketplace add mindmorass/reflex
/plugin install reflex
```

**Local development:**
```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/reflex
```
