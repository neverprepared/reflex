# Analysis Patterns

Patterns for data analysis, metrics evaluation, and systematic troubleshooting.

## Core Approaches

### Data Analysis
- Examine data for patterns, anomalies, and insights
- Assess performance metrics and KPIs
- Visualize complex relationships with mermaid or graphviz

### Systematic Troubleshooting
- **Divide and conquer**: Split problem space in half repeatedly
- **Binary search**: Isolate variables to find root cause
- **Timeline analysis**: Map events chronologically

## Analysis Checklist

1. **Context**: Understand the full picture before diving in
2. **Data quality**: Verify data accuracy and completeness
3. **Patterns**: Look for trends, cycles, outliers
4. **Root cause**: Don't stop at symptoms
5. **Evidence**: Document findings with supporting data
6. **Visualization**: Create diagrams to communicate findings

## Visualization Tools

Use `graphviz-diagrams` skill or `documentation-generator:mermaid-expert` for:
- Flowcharts showing data flow
- Sequence diagrams for event timelines
- State diagrams for system states
- Pie/bar charts for distributions
